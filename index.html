            I am a dedicated and enthusiastic full stack developer and a recent graduate of Thinkful's Full Stack Flex course.  I love web development. 
            Everything from dreaming up that new app idea, to working with other developers, to showing off a finished application,  make it an ever exciting pursuit. I 
            especially enjoy learning new frameworks and libraries that change the way I approach problems and the development process. 
        </p>
        <p class="about-me-p">
            Away from coding, I keep myself busy with watching the Red Sox, playing 
            my violin, going on a hike or playing tennis, getting a drink with friends, maybe some baking, or 
            just kicking back with a book. I don't like the same old, same old. And I believe that's why I love 
            being a web developer: there's just so much to do out there.

        <p class="app-description threetv-description">I think I can say with a fair amount confidence that everybody uses YouTube, most pretty regularly. And because building a web app 
          that would interest a wide range of people was very appealing to me, I thought an app that integrated YouTube would be just the thing 
          to build. Retro YouTube was a project where I wanted to not only use the YouTube API, but use it in a way I hadn't seen before. I
          wanted to display YouTube videos in an entirely different way and change the way the User interacts with the videos. This led me to
          display the video results on a 3D model of a old fashioned television. In order to stay consistent with the idea of TV, I decided users would
          interact with videos by using their phone as a remote, which renders via media queries when the site is loaded on mobile.

        Yes, it sounds like a dating site, but it's actually an app that aims to connect tennis players with each other. I have loved tennis
        for a long time, but growing up in Bardstown, KY, it was always a challenge to find new people to play matches with, outside of high 
        school competitions. Everybody tended to stick with the two or three people they usually played with. There was an ample pool of
        talented players from all ages, but there was nothing connecting them. Match-Er tries to solve that problem by giving users the 
        ability to friend nearby tennis players, send and receive invitations to matches, arrange the time and place, save the scores of
        completed matches, and track their overall record.

          Task-Timer started out as timer for Rubik's cubes that would keep record of all solve times. However, I quickly realized that this 
          idea wouldn't appeal to, let alone be useful to, most people, so I reworked it as a timer for tasks people like me occupy themselves 
          with. Users select a task from a dropdown such as checking email, catching up on news, or studying and press "Start." A timer runs 
          until the user decides to stop their task. After stopping the task, the user is able to make notes on what they specifically they 
          worked on, or what they accomplished. The task's title, time, date, and notes are saved and can be viewed along with other previous 
          tasks. Parts of the development of this app, such as building a timer with JavaScript, were challenging but enjoyable.
